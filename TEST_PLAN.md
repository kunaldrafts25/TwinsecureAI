# TwinSecure Test Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the TwinSecure platform, covering both backend and frontend components.

## 1. Backend Testing

### 1.1 Unit Tests

| Test Category | Description | Tools |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| API Endpoints | Test individual API endpoints for correct responses | pytest, requests |
| Database Models | Test model validation, relationships, and constraints | pytest, SQLAlchemy |
| Services | Test business logic in service modules | pytest |
| Utilities | Test helper functions and utilities | pytest |

#### Implementation Strategy:
- Use pytest fixtures for database setup and teardown
- Mock external services and dependencies
- Test both success and error cases
- Ensure high code coverage (aim for >80%)

### 1.2 Integration Tests

| Test Category | Description | Tools |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| API Flows | Test complete API workflows (e.g., user registration to login) | pytest, requests |
| Database Integration | Test database operations with actual PostgreSQL | pytest, asyncpg |
| Service Integration | Test interactions between services | pytest |

#### Implementation Strategy:
- Use test database for integration tests
- Set up test data before tests and clean up after
- Test realistic user workflows
- Test with different user roles and permissions

### 1.3 Performance Tests

| Test Category | Description | Tools |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Load Testing | Test system under expected load | locust |
| Stress Testing | Test system under extreme load | locust |
| Endurance Testing | Test system over extended periods | custom scripts |

#### Implementation Strategy:
- Define realistic user scenarios
- Measure response times, throughput, and error rates
- Test with different numbers of concurrent users
- Identify performance bottlenecks

### 1.4 Security Tests

| Test Category | Description | Tools |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Authentication | Test authentication mechanisms | pytest |
| Authorization | Test role-based access control | pytest |
| Input Validation | Test input validation and sanitization | pytest |
| Token Security | Test JWT token security | pytest, pyjwt |

#### Implementation Strategy:
- Test with different user roles
- Test with invalid tokens and credentials
- Test for common security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Test rate limiting and brute force protection

## 2. Frontend Testing

### 2.1 Unit Tests

| Test Category | Description | Tools |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Components | Test individual React components | Vitest, React Testing Library |
| Hooks | Test custom React hooks | Vitest, React Testing Library |
| Utilities | Test helper functions and utilities | Vitest |
| State Management | Test state management (Zustand stores) | Vitest |

#### Implementation Strategy:
- Test component rendering and behavior
- Mock API calls and external dependencies
- Test both success and error states
- Ensure high code coverage (aim for >80%)

### 2.2 Integration Tests

| Test Category | Description | Tools |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Page Flows | Test complete page workflows | Vitest, React Testing Library |
| Form Submissions | Test form validation and submission | Vitest, React Testing Library |
| API Integration | Test integration with API services | Vitest, MSW |

#### Implementation Strategy:
- Mock API responses for consistent testing
- Test user interactions and workflows
- Test form validation and error handling
- Test loading, success, and error states

### 2.3 End-to-End Tests

| Test Category | Description | Tools |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| User Flows | Test complete user workflows | Playwright |
| Cross-Browser | Test across different browsers | Playwright |
| Responsive Design | Test across different screen sizes | Playwright |

#### Implementation Strategy:
- Test critical user journeys
- Test across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Test on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Record videos and screenshots for debugging

## 3. Test Automation

### 3.1 CI/CD Integration

| Stage | Tests to Run | Trigger |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Pull Request | Unit tests, linting | On PR creation/update |
| Merge to Develop | Unit tests, integration tests | On merge to develop |
| Merge to Main | All tests including E2E | On merge to main |

#### Implementation Strategy:
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Run tests in parallel where possible
- Cache dependencies to speed up builds
- Generate and publish test reports

### 3.2 Test Data Management

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Fixtures | Predefined test data for unit and integration tests |
| Factories | Dynamic test data generation |
| Seeding | Database seeding for E2E tests |

#### Implementation Strategy:
- Create reusable test fixtures
- Use factories for flexible test data generation
- Seed test database with realistic data for E2E tests
- Clean up test data after tests

## 4. Test Coverage Goals

| Component | Coverage Goal |
|-----------|---------------|
| Backend API Endpoints | 90% |
| Backend Services | 85% |
| Backend Utilities | 80% |
| Frontend Components | 85% |
